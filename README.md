# World-GINI-Plot
A animated line plot of world GINI index over time (1800 - 2050)
The data was from Gapminder website. The data was about GINI index of 196 countries as you can see in the 'gini.xlsx' file.
To get the world GINI index mean, I took mean of all the countries for each year and saved it in a different dataframe and in different file because I am not very expereinced yet. Input would be appreciated. Thanks for reading :)
